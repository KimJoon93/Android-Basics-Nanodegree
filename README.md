### Making an App Interactive: Part 1
+ Create Coffee machine
+ Try using method that calls when button is clicked. 
+ Using variable means kind of using boxes. Such as putting information to the boxes.
For example We want information num=5 then we should use integer or etc. So we put int num=5 to the boxes.
+ If we want to use "" in String we should use backslash with \".

### Project: Quiz App
+ Color Quiz App\
    I made color quiz app solving which one is correct color name.
    I made 5 question that gives 20 points and if we click score btn it checks the question is right or wrong.
    And I give toast message what point we get. 

+ Review from Udacity\
    I got a review from Udacity that app has 3 things to change. But I think problem occurs because of using less views.
    So I add checkbox for checking "Did you solve by yourself". And I add name EditText so when we click the score button,
    Toast message show us the name and the score. And it works!
