### Intents and Activities

+ Implicit Intent / Explicit Inent
    1. Implicit Intent\
        <code>Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_SENDTO);</code>
    2. Explicit Intent\
        <code>Intent intent = new Intent(this, classname.class);</code>
+ Difference between class and Interface?
    1. Class(Fully implemented)
        - contains state
        - Methods are fully implemented
    
    2. Abstract Class(Partially implemented)
        - Contains state
        - Some methods are fully implemented
        - Some methods are abstract
    
    3. Interface(Not implemented at all)
        - No state
        - All methods are abstract(Not implemented)
        - Interface defines what a class should do but not how to do it.
        - Think about Java class couldn't  get multiple inheritance.
