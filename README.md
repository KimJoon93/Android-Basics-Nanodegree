### Intents and Activities

+ Implicit Intent / Explicit Inent
    1. Implicit Intent
    ```
        Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_SENDTO);
        
        StartActivity(intent);
    ```
    2. Explicit Intent
    ```
        Intent intent = new Intent(this, classname.class);
        StartActivity(intent);
    ```    
+ Difference between class and Interface?
    1. Class(Fully implemented)
        - contains state
        - Methods are fully implemented
    
    2. Abstract Class(Partially implemented)
        - Contains state
        - Some methods are fully implemented
        - Some methods are abstract
    
    3. Interface(Not implemented at all)
        - No state
        - All methods are abstract(Not implemented)
        - Interface defines what a class should do but not how to do it.
        - Think about Java class couldn't  get multiple inheritance.

### Arrays,Lists, Loops, & Custom Classes

+ When to use Arrays
    - Travel App (item to pack for traveling) : array of Strings
    - YouTube app (number of views) : integer
    - Setting app (languages supported) : array of Strings
    - Shopping app (whether a product is in stock) : boolean
    - Lottery app (winning combination of 5 numbers for a single round in the lottery) : array of integer
    - Health track app (miles or km walked for each day) : array of float

+ How to use array
    - Create array
    ```
    int[] shoesize = new int[3];
    ```
    - Initialize elements in an array
    ```
    shoesize[0] = 5;
    shoesize[1] = 7;
    shoesize[2] = 11;
    ```
    - Access elements in an array
    ```
    shoesize[0]; --> value of 5
    shoesize[1]; --> value of 7
    shoesize[2]; --> value of 11
    ```
    - Get the array length
    ```
    showsize.length --> value of 3
    ```
+ How to create and access elements in an ArrayList
    - Create an ArrayList
    ```
    ArrayList<String> library = new ArrayList<String>();
    ```
    - Add elements in an ArrayList
    ```
    library.add("Momo");
    library.add("LaLaLand");
    //Add an element at a specific index
    library.add(0, "quang");
    ```
    - Access elements in an ArrayList
    ```
    library.get(0);
    library.get(1);
    library.get(2);
    ```
    - Remove elements from an ArrayList
    ```
    //Remove the element at the specific index
    library.remove(2);
    ```
    - Get the ArrayList length or size
    ```
    library.size();
    ```
+ Why don't we use ArrayList instead of array?\
    Each one has another functions that fits to the program. If we want fixed size such as Weekday,(Monday, tuesday, ...) we can use array.
    But if we want fluid situation we could use ArrayList.

    Question | Array | ArrayList
    --------- | --------- | ---------
    Can change size once created? | No | Yes
    Is a class? | No | Yes
    Uses methods to access and modify elements? | No | Yes
    What can it store? | Primitive and Objects | Only objects
