## Ch.2 UserInterface
### Introduction (Making single screen app)

+ TextView can be surrounded with Layout
+ Pixels can be different in many devices, so we should use 'dp'. It can have same physical size.
+ Make touch targets 48dp at least.
+ Use 'sp' rather than 'dp' when resizing the text. 
+ Use src to show ImageView rather than using background.(My most mistakes came out from here.)
+ Try to search documentation when something is wrong.

### Build Birthday card App
